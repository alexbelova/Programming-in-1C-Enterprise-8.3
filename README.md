<h2 align="left">About</h2>
<p>The organization carries out trading activities, which consists in buying goods from suppliers and manufacturers. Further actions are reduced to the sale of these goods through a retail network consisting of several branches. Sometimes some products are transferred to the exhibition to advertise the assortment. The reverse process takes place â€“ the transfer of goods from the exhibition to the branches. The developed computer accounting system registers these movements. When selling goods, the results of managers' work are also taken into account for their subsequent monetary remuneration.</p>
